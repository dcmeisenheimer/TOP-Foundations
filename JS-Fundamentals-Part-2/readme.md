JavaScript Fundamentals Part 2 Lesson Overview

- Name the eight data types in JavaScript.
    1. Number = both integer and floating point numbers
    2. BigInt = BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
        A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer.
    3. String = must be surrounded by quotes.
    4. Boolean (logical Type) = has two types true or false.
    5. null value = does not belong to any of the types.
    6. undefined = for unassigned values - a standalone type that has a single value.
    7. Symbol = for unique identifiers.
    8. Object = for more complex data structures.

- Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.
    1. In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
        Double quotes: "Hello".
        Single quotes: 'Hello'.
        Backticks: `Hello`.
    2. Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

    3. Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example

- Embed a variable/expression in a string.

- Understand what a method is.
    1. A method is a bit of functionality that is built into the language or into specific data types.

- Name the three logical operators.
    1. AND &&
    2. OR || 
    3. NOT !=

- Understand what the comparison operators are.
    1. Greater/less than a > b, a < b
    2. Greater/less than or equals a => b, a <= b
    3. Equals a == b (equality test), a = b (assignment)
    4. Not equals a != b.

- Understand what conditionals are.
    1. if = specificy a block of code to be executed.
    2. else
    3. else if
    4. Switch

- Understand what nesting is.
    1. Allows you to put conditional statements within each other.

- Understand what truthy and falsy values are.
    1. falsy = code will never execute within a condition.
    2. truthy = code will always execute within a condition.
